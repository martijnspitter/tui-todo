## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Application displays incorrectly with broken characters or formatting
**Solution**: Ensure your terminal supports TUI applications and try setting `TERM=xterm-256color` environment variable

**Issue**: "Command not found" error after installation
**Solution**: Make sure the installation directory is in your PATH environment variable. You might need to restart your terminal.

**Issue**: Database access errors
**Solution**: Check that the application has write permissions to the directory where it stores data

**Issue**: Keyboard shortcuts not working as expected
**Solution**: Some terminal emulators might capture certain key combinations. Try using alternative key bindings or configure your terminal to pass these key combinations through.
